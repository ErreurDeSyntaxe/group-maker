            Someimtes, all we need is randomness to accept our sorry lot in
            life. The Romans of the last century BCE sure didn't draw the
            winning lot. They were born around the time of Marius and Sulla's
            civil war and purge. They reached adulthood in time to witness
            another civil war between Julius Caesar and the corrupt Senate. They
            were reaching the winters of their lives when Octavian took on Mark
            Antony. All you have to do is let fate decide your teammate(s). The
            die is cast.
