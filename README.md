## Architecture

```javascript
class Group {
  constructor(number, nameList) {
    this.number = number;
    this.nameList = nameList;
  }
}

class Teacher {
  constructor(name, groups) {
    this.name = name;
    this.groups = groups;
  }
}

class App {
  constructor() {
    this.init();
  }

  init() {
    // Initialization logic here
  }
}

## Lessons & Difficulties

- Using GitHub Pages with Vite requires careful handling of base paths and routing.
- React Context API simplifies state management for student lists.
- Preplanning folder structure and assets saves time during refactoring.
