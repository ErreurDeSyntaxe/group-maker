            Sometimes, all we need is randomness to accept our sorry lot in
            life. The Romans of the last century BCE sure didn't draw the
            winning ticket. They were born in time for Marius and Sulla' civil
            war and purges. They saw Julius Caesar cross the Rubicon. They
            weren't old enough to escape Octavian take on Mark Antony. All you
            have to do is let fate decide your teammates. The die is cast.
